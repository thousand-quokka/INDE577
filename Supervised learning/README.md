# Supervised Learning

## Introduction
Supervised learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves training a model using labeled data. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping function from input variables to output variables based on a set of training examples. In this readme file, we will provide an overview of supervised learning, its types, and the basic steps involved in the supervised learning process.

## Types of Supervised Learning
Supervised learning can be classified into two types: regression and classification.

### Regression
Regression is a type of supervised learning where the output variable is a continuous value. Regression models are used to predict a numerical value, such as the price of a house based on its features, or the revenue of a company based on its sales data.

### Classification
Classification is a type of supervised learning where the output variable is a categorical value. In classification models, we predict which category a given input belongs to. For example, we can classify an email as spam or not spam based on its contents, or we can predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on their medical records.

## Basic Steps in Supervised Learning
The basic steps involved in supervised learning are as follows:

1. Data Collection: Collect and prepare the dataset that will be used for training and testing the model.

2. Data Preprocessing: Perform preprocessing on the data to remove any missing or irrelevant data, normalize or standardize the data, and split the data into training and testing sets.

3. Model Selection: Select a model that is appropriate for the given problem. This involves choosing a type of model, such as linear regression, logistic regression, or decision trees, and tuning the hyperparameters of the model.

4. Training the Model: Train the model on the training data using an appropriate algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent or backpropagation.

5. Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model on the testing data. This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. Model Deployment: Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be deployed for use in production.
